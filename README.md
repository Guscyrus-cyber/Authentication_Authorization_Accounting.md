Reflection on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

Authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of a user. In this scenario, the user "Legal\Administrator" was identified from the event log with their IP address, which helped trace the incident. Strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), could improve verification to ensure the legitimacy of users accessing sensitive resources.

Authorization involves granting specific permissions based on verified identities. The excessive access level granted to "Legal\Administrator" was a significant issue, allowing them to perform unauthorized financial transactions. Implementing the principle of least privilege ensures that users are only allowed access to the resources necessary for their specific roles, thus reducing the risk of misuse.

Accounting involves tracking and maintaining records of user activities, access rights, and changes in the system. In this case, the lack of timely review and deactivation of inappropriate accounts, like "Legal\Administrator," led to security risks. Proper accounting practices ensure that actions are logged, reviewed, and adjusted accordingly to maintain security and accountability.

Recommendations for Improvement

Enhance Authentication: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive data and systems.

Strengthen Authorization Controls: Enforce the principle of least privilege by restricting user access to only those resources required for their specific roles, and regularly review and adjust access permissions. Improve Accounting: Implement regular audits and reviews of user activity logs and account access to ensure timely detection and rectification of any unauthorized access or suspicious activities. This will help maintain a high level of accountability and security.
